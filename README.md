# UFO_Analysis
# Analysis Overview #
This project refines a javascript data set of UFO observations and creates a dynamic table in HTML that allows the curious observer to search for other similar UFO occurrences. The table can filter UFO observations by the following criteria. 
<ul>
    <li>The date of occurrence</li>
    <li>The nearest city</li>
    <li>The state in which it took place</li>
    <li>The country</il>
    <li>The shape of the supposed UFO</li>
</ul>
